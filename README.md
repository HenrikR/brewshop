## Getting started

You'll need

- git
- Node.js
- npm

To start, clone `brewshop`

``` bash
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:HenrikR/brewshop.git
cd brewshop
```

Install the dev dependencies (run with `sudo` if need be).

``` bash
npm install
```

Watch files for compilation.

``` bash
npm start
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
